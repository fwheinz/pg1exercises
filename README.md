# PG1 Exercises

This repository contains a *codespaces* environment for programming exercises.

To create your own codespace perform the following steps:

- Create a github account, if you do not have one yet
- Sign in to your github account
- Visit the URL **https://github.com/fwheinz/pg1exercises** (this repository)
- Click on the green button **<> Code**
- Click on the green button **Create codespace on main**
- **Important:** Be patient! Wait until all elements on the screen are settled. This may take up to 10 minutes.

Start coding:

- Choose the File Explorer (top symbol on the left)
- Choose an exercise folder
- Work on the source files

Execute your program:

- Open the OTH menu on the left side (sometimes the icon is not showing, it is directly below the last icon on the left side)
- Choose "Compile&Start". This will compile the project with the most recently changed source file
- **Important** Watch out for compile warnings and errors in the terminal on the bottom!
- If the program started successfully the terminal will provide the input and output of the process
- If your program is GUI based (e.g. Karel or SPL) you can open the graphical view in the OTH menu either in a separate browser window or in a VSCode Tab.

Good luck!
